# Introduction:

Sudoku is a logic-based puzzle game that has become extremely popular in recent years. The objective of the game is to fill a 9×9 grid with numbers so that each row, column, and 3×3 sub-grid contains all of the digits from 1 to 9. Although this may sound relatively simple, the challenge lies in the fact that each puzzle has only one unique solution. Sudoku can be played online or in print, and there are numerous books and apps dedicated to the game. Many people find Sudoku to be an enjoyable and addictive pastime, as it provides a mental challenge and can be played at any time and anywhere.

# Algorithm
![# Backtracking Algorithm](https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/BackTracking%20Algorithm%20-%20Soni/state-space-tree-in-backtracking-algorithm.png)
Backtracking is an algorithmic technique whose goal is to use brute force to find all solutions to a problem. It entails gradually compiling a set of all possible solutions. Because a problem will have constraints, solutions that do not meet them will be removed.

## Write a sudoku solver in JavaScript using backtracking algorithms

**Now we will need several functions to :**

 - Convert Html Table to JS array
 - Check input integer [1-9]
 - Find the next empty position
 - Check a value in a row
 - Check a value in a column
 - Check a value in a 9 squared box
 - Find The Solution
 - Reset inputs.
